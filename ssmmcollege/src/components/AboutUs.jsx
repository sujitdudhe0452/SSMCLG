          Day by day this tree out of the seed is growing bigger & bigger with flourishing and spreading its branches with the holy blessings of Goddess Saraswati in all over the district. It was their fervor and commitment that has made PTCES as what we see today. Their vision of things was unparalleled and so was their practical and hands-off approach, which helped the next generation of equally capable leadership to develop at PTCES. Their legacy endures; PTCES continues to offer broad-based and student-oriented courses ranging from Arts to Science & Technology. The same efforts are nourished by its successive directors for its maximum output. The society’s new chairman with young & dynamic personality Mr. Sanjay Onkar Wagh [Chairman] of PTCES, Pachora. The Blessings of Shri. O.N.Wagh (Ex.MLA) & the full support of Shri. D.O.Wagh (Hon.MLA) is also an important asset.
