            Our mother institution, Pachora Taluka Co-Operative Education Society Limited, was established in 1936 with the sublime and selfless aim "to promote education facilities to the residents of Pachora and nearby villages." The Society was registered under the Co-operative Society Act on 14th December 1936. Keeping the perspiration and aspiration of the rural farmer community at the center, the society started a secondary school in Pachora in 1936.

            As time passed, with financial assistance from social organizations and generous citizens, the education society flourished and played a creative and constructive role in providing education from pre-primary to higher education. The idea of 'man-making education' enshrined in the minds of the founders, our parent institution started the senior college in Arts and commerce stream in the year 1970. The very next year, Science was permitted. Then the college was affiliated with the Poona University.

            In December 1973, our college got recognition under section 2(f) of the UGC Act. It is automatically recognized under section 12(B) of the UGC Act, as it was established in the year 1970. Due to the increasing student strength, there was a need for a separate building for the senior college. The true efforts of the management for the development of the college turned out to be fruitful, and a piece of land of about 13 acres was purchased in the Bhadgaon Road premises of Pachora town. The generosity of Shri Sheth Muralidharji Mansingka turned out to be helpful to the management, and the construction of the college building was started. The senior college got shifted to the new building in the academic year 1988-89.

            As an educational institution, our college has maintained its acceptable educational standard. The institution has competent teaching staff struggling to provide the best to the students. As a result, there are rank holders in the university examinations. With pride and pleasure, it is humbly stated that our college has been rendering valuable services in the field of higher education to the mofussil students. Presently, our college is affiliated with the North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon, since 1991. Our 'Perfection Hungry' management is trying to overcome the problems, and all of us together are striving to make it perfect.
